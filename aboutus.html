subtitle: And our robot friends
---

<p>MIT CRC is a club dedicated to producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_combat">combat robots</a> of all shapes and sizes. These robots are pitted against other robots in three minute competitions with the single goal of causing as much damage as possible to their opponents. </p>

<p>But more than that, MIT CRC is a group of students who come together to learn from each other and grow as engineers and individuals. Everyone's first robot is bound to fail; we exist to help make everyone's second robot do better!</p>
