Some parts of our butt were impractical to machine on our HAAS, so we machined them on the HAAS anyways.

With this last part done, our butt started to come together!

None of the holes are tapped, but it's satisfying to see the whole thing in one piece. Despite its size, it weighs suprisingly little due to the aggressive pocketing.

Nobody, of course, is looking forwards to tapping the rest of the holes.
