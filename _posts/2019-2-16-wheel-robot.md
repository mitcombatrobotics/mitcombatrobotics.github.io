Blanks were bored out on our Hardinge and thrown into a CNC for weight reduction.

The only slitting saw we had was the size of a record and about as dull as one. But hey, you make do.

The final hubs probably won't be this shiny after a fight, but we'll enjoy it while we can. We'll play tribute to the most American machinist out there on the inner face.

On a completely different note: How do you figure out if your robot is actually invertable? A: You make it!

It's a scaled down/COM-fixed model of the full sized robot printed on a Form 2. We're already ready to kick some ass in the antweight ring.

It looks like our robot is invertable! Not bad, little dude.
