After a couple months of design, our CAD model is starting to take its final form!

The fist weapon isn't modeled yet, but most everything else is included. Forks let us get under our opponents and hit them with our ~60lb blade while the back end (aptly named Butt.sldasm) keeps our electronics safe. Note the fully invertable design.

"But what if you fight a horizontal spinner?"

An detachable AR500 wedge lets us deflect nasty horizontal spinners while keeping our front safe. The backup forks on the top make sure that we're still slightly invertable.

With the CAD mostly done, we're finally ready to start manufacturing parts. Will our waterjet ever forgive us after we're done with it? Stay tuned to find out.
