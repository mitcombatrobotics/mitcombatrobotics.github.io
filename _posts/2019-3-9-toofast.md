title:  "The Butt Is Flying Fast"

We decided to get our robot running without its front half as a sanity check. This involved a lot of cardboard, duct tape, and electronics stuffing.

Our calculations told us that our robot would go fast, but we didn't really have a sense for what "fast" meant until we took it out on the pavement.

We clocked this thing at a max speed of ~20mph - which is pretty terrifying for a box with no front wheels! We somehow don't think that speed will be a problem.

Torque isn't a problem either; the motor torque is mostly matched to the grip of the tires, so we start slipping before we start stalling.

All of this pushing was making our robot a little aggressive, so we decided to let it blow off some steam and took it for a relaxing walk. Always remember to walk your robot!
