MIT CRC is a club dedicated to producing [combat robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_combat) of all shapes and sizes. These robots are pitted against other robots in three minute competitions with the single goal of causing as much damage as possible to their opponents. 

But more than that, MIT CRC is a group of students who come together to learn from each other and grow as engineers and individuals. Everyone's first robot is bound to fail; we exist to help make everyone's second robot do better!
