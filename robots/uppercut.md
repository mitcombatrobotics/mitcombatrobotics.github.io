This 250lb behemoth fought on the fourth season of Discovery Channel's Battlebots.

An aluminum-steel composite frame supports two massive brushless motors that spin a ~50lb fist up to incredible speeds.

The hardened front wedge of the robot deflects the attacks of other robots and slides under opponents during head on collisions - leaving them exposed to the main weapon.

Our fights will be airing on this next season of Battlebots. Stay tuned to see how dangerous this machine gets!
