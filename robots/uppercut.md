This 250lb beheamoth (currently in the making) is built to fight on the official Battlebots show.

An aluminum-steel composite frame supports two massive brushless motors that spin a ~50lb fist up to incredible speeds.

The hardened front wedge of the robot deflects the attacks of other robots and slides under opponents during head on collisions - leaving them exposed to the main weapon. We predict that more than one robot will end up plastered on the ceiling of the battlebox.

Stay tuned to see future updates on the progress of this robot! We'll be posting build logs on both our site and our facebook page.
