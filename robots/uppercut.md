An aluminum-steel composite frame supports two massive brushless motors that spin a ~50lb fist up to incredible speeds.

The hardened front wedge of the robot deflects the attacks of other robots and slides under opponents during head on collisions - leaving them exposed to the main weapon.

Our robot made it to the final elimination tournament of season 4 with a 4-2 win-loss record! Catch our fights on Discovery to see how they went down.
